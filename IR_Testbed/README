These scripts are utilized to analyze the spectral and polarimetric response of the IR test bed using a FLIR boson. 

single_cam_mono_sweep.py finds the spectral response of the Boson. 
polarized_scan_singleboson.py uses the boson and a motorized rotating polarizer to find the polarimetric response of the monochromator. 
The data collected with this code was used to find the DOLP and AOLP of the monochromator as a function of wavelength
singlebosonchamberscan.py uses the boson and a motorized rotating polarizer to find the polarimetric response of the blackbody calibration target
The data collected with this code can be used to find the DOLP and AOLP of the Blackbody as a function of temperature

Dark field measurements were taken to account for detector offset. 
The boson was left to warm to room temperature after setup of experiement before starting experiment to account for FPA temperature drift
